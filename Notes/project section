Mosaic website:

I am creating a blog page. My idea is a webpage that renders in order whatever
html is stored in the database in short sections. So there's no standard format necessary.
Meaning each blog post can be different if I want it to be.
I would also want to create a standard format that I use as well.

What to do now:

Get it so the blog page exists.

Make there be a database.
Make the structure of the data.


Make the blog page show database stored renedered html and stuff.
Make a standard template for blog posts.
Make it so you can have article categories to organize what blog are shown.
Add in filters so the database can be filtered.


Next things above in ordered list
